# ADVENT-OF-CODE-2015

Ever since my 2nd semester in my current course ( Informatics and Computing Engineering @ FEUP BSc (3 years) + MSc (2 years)), I've gained the motivation to start solving exercises that weren't meant to be solved in any of my course units. 

Therefore, after a few months exploring Python, I've decided that I would take on this Advent of Code v2015 with what I know, and hope for the best.

With that said, I hope you enjoy exploring your doubts in here, and be sure to let me know if you think some upgrading needs to be done in my solutions. All of the help is appreciated.

Happy Coding!!
